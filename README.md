Basic Recipe Site for TOP Practice

At this point I'm gaining a basic understanding of using the command line.
I can use HTML on a very basic level i.e. writing the boilerplate,
adding images, the paragraph element, strong and em elements/tags, etc. 

In this project, I am going to set up a very simple website with my new skills.
This will be ugly as hell, but hey that's practice! Looking forward to this!
