    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Over medium-high heat,heat olive oil in <strong>large</strong> sauce pan</li>
            <li>Once hot, add ground beef to sauce pan. Breaking up beef as it cooks</li>
            <li>Once beef is lightly browned, add in your diced onion</li>
            <li>After the onions have become translucent (about five minutes) add your garlic, tomatoe paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>After about one minute or until garlic is fragrant, pour in the vegetable stock or water </li>
            <li>Add crushed tomatoes, salt and pepper bringing sauce to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Simmer for roughly 25 minutes. Stirring occassionaly</li>
            <li>As the sauce simmers, after about 10 minutes in a separate pot, add enough water and add your pasta</li>
            <li>After about 8 minutes or until pasta is al dente, you will add the basil to the sauce</li>
            <li>Make sure to save some basil and finely cut it for topping the finished dish!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once the basil has been added it's a good idea to let the pasta sit in the sauce for at least a minute so it can absorb the sauce and flavor!</p>
